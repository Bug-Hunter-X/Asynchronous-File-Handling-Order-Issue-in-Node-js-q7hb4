# Node.js Asynchronous File Handling Order Issue

This repository demonstrates a common misconception in Node.js asynchronous programming related to file I/O.

## The Problem

The `processFile` function uses `fs.readFile` to read a file asynchronously.  The expectation is that 'File processing started...' would be logged first. However, due to the asynchronous nature of `fs.readFile`, the callback function might execute later than the `console.log` outside of it, leading to unexpected output order.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding that asynchronous operations don't block execution.  The code's logic needs to reflect this to handle the output correctly.  The solution provided demonstrates using Promises or async/await to manage the asynchronous operations and ensures the proper order of execution.
